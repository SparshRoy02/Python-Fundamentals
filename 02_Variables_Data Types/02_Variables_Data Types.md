### Variables

Variables are containers that store information that can be manipulated and referenced later by the programmer within the code.

In Python, the programmer does not need to declare the variable type explicitly; we just need to assign the value to the variable.


Example:
```shell
name = "Sparsh"     # type str
age = 23            # type int
passed = True       # type bool
```

It is always advisable to keep variable names descriptive and to follow a set of conventions while creating variables:

- Variable names can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores (A-Z, 0-9, and _).
- Variable names must start with a letter or the underscore character.
- Variables are case sensitive.
- Variable names cannot start with a number.

Example:

```shell
Color = "yellow"    # valid variable name
cOlor = "red"       # valid variable name
_color = "blue"     # valid variable name
 
5color = "green"    # invalid variable name
$color = "orange"   # invalid variable name


2name = "Bob"       # invalid variable names as it starts with a number  
class = 10          # invalid variable names as 'class' is a keyword 
```
